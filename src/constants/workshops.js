  title: 'Who is Filipino Enough',
  description: '<p>“You are not Filipino, you are American.” It wasn\'t until I was 18 that I realized that I could be both: Filipino-American. It was an identity that bridged the collectivistic values that my Filipina mother raised me with and the individualistic values I experienced in American society. However, my answer to the question: "What does being Filipino mean to you ?” is far from over and constantly evolving. From the debate between the usage of Filipino vs. Filipinx, the twitter fires between diaspora Filipinos and Filipinos living in the Philippines, and the current events of the Philippines; I can only assume that my fellow Filipinos and Filipino-Americans must feel the same. This workshop aims to help delegates understand how Filipinos, Filipinxs, and Filipino-Americans alike can navigate through their identity and define for themselves who is Filipino enough.</p>',

  title: 'Queering Filipin(x/a/o) Identity ',
  description: 'Within existing popular media, the Filipinx/a/o individual is often represented in a flat, stationary manner—if represented at all. This workshop aims to disturb the stagnant portrayal of the Filipinx/a/o experience by looking at Queer experiences in the American Diaspora, focusing on the intricacies of identity resulting from the Philippines’ history of colonization and immigration. The importance of representation in media is crucial, in many instances it informs how outsider perspectives frame a group of people and culture, how an individual perceives themselves, and how that inevitably affects mental and community wellbeing. However, it is also important to address the disenfranchised material conditions that many Filipinx/a/o folks experience that "representatsian" politics fail to engage with. By addressing and educating youth on the complexities of the Filipinx/a/o experience, this workshop hopes to give the Filipinx/a/o community the means to organize and the tools for critically thinking about the representation of Filipinx/a/o selfhood and experience, as well as to collectivize and push for the recognition of intersectional Filipinx/a/o identities.',

By exploring how their culture is consumed, digested, and regurgitated, they begin to unpack the oppressive constructs implanted within their country and people. After graduating with a BFA with an emphasis in Art History from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, they formed an artist collective, Export Quality, together with other Queer Filipinx alumni. As an emerging artist, De La Rose has had the opportunity to showcase their work in group shows in cities like Chicago, Los Angeles, Johnson City, New York, and Toronto. In collaboration with AFIRE Chicago, Export Quality, was awarded the Crossroads Youth Fund for Cultural Change to support their documentary series Nakikita.
